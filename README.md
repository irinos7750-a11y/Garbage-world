Garbage World is a worldbuilding project set in a collapsing future where humanity’s waste has reshaped Earth into layered garbage continents, floating megacities, and mutated underworlds filled with bio-horrors.

## 🌍 World Structure
### 1. Sky Metropolises
Floating techno-medieval megacities controlled by wealthy technocrat states.  
Isolated, militaristic, and connected by holy-like “Garbage Crusades” fought with laser-age weaponry.

### 2. Upper Garbage
A chaotic, radioactive wasteland built from centuries of compacted trash.  
Home to scavengers, smugglers, hunters, and rogue machines.

### 3. Downer Garbage
The deepest, ancient layers of pre-collapse waste.  
Chemical + biological anomalies create supernatural properties and mutated creatures.

## 💥 Origin of the Collapse
Humanity dumped mass waste into an artificial micro black hole.  
A chain reaction caused it to explode, scattering energized trash across the solar system.  
Earth was buried under kilometers of debris, machines gained self-awareness, and humans mutated.
